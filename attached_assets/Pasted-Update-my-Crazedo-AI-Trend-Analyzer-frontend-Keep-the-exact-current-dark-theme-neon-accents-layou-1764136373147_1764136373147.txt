Update my Crazedo AI Trend Analyzer frontend.
Keep the exact current dark theme, neon accents, layout, and spacing.
Do NOT redesign anything.
Only add the following upgrades under the “Google Trends – Interest Over Time (7 Days)” section.

1. Add “What This Graph Shows” explanation (short text):

“This chart shows daily search interest for the last 7 days.”

“100 = peak popularity, 50 = medium, 0 = low.”

2. Add auto-generated “Trend Interpretation” box using the 7-day data.
Example text: “Momentum increased earlier in the week…”

3. Add “Trend Strength Score (0–100)”
Formula: average interest + week-over-week change (capped at 100).
Display as: “Trend Strength Score: XX/100.”

4. Add markers for key days calculated from the trend data:

Peak Day

Lowest Day

Today’s Value

7-Day Change %

5. Add “Week-over-Week Comparison” using a basic comparison to the previous 7-day average (use mock data if needed).

6. Add a “Why Interest Spiked” box (AI-style short reasoning) using patterns from the numbers and related queries.

7. Add a CTA box:
“See Full Trend Analysis →”
Link to /blogs/weekly-google-trends or placeholder.

8. Add a “Trend Prediction (Next 3 Days)” module with simple rules:

If last 3 days increasing → “Likely to keep rising”

If last 3 days decreasing → “Likely to decline further”

Else → “Unstable / neutral short-term forecast”

9. Add a “Trend Type” tag generated from related queries or topic name. Options:

Sports, News, Finance, Influencer, Music, Gaming, Viral, Celebrity, Tech.

10. Add a “Popularity Index (1–10)” based on average interest.

11. Add “Trending Regions” section (top 5 from the trend API or mock data).
Display as simple text list, no map needed.

12. Add a “Trend Lifecycle Phase” using momentum:

Exploding, Rising, Cooling, Declining, Stabilizing.

13. Add a “Momentum Meter” visual bar (simple horizontal bar):
Example: ████████░░ 78%

14. Add a “Snapshot Summary” box containing:

Trend level (Exploding/Rising/etc.)

7-day change %

Peak day

Top region

Popularity index

3-day prediction
